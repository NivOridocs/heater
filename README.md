# Heater

**Heater** is a tech mod which adds precisely two blocks, the **Heater** and the **Heat Pipe**.

The **Heater** block is a furnace-like block but without any processing slot. Instead, whenever it burns something, it propagates the produced heat to every connected actual furnace, like Furnaces, Blast Furnaces, and Smokers for vanilla Minecraft, but also [Haunt Furnaces](https://modrinth.com/mod/haunt-furnace) and [Kilns](https://modrinth.com/mod/embers-kiln).

In other words, the **Heater** allows you to centralise the burning process and avoid building complex fuel lines.

On the other hand, the **Heat Pipe** is a pipe-like block that just extends the reach of a **Heater** up to 64 blocks.
